# SignaturenDruck

This is a Electron application to print shelfmarks read from a `.dnl`-file. It displays shelfmarks from the file in a table like structure. You can then select and print the shelfmarks you like.

The printing process creates two `.pdf`-files (each for one size) and proceeds to print them silently via Foxit Reader.



To use this application you'll need to install [Foxit Reader v6.2.3.0815](http://cdn01.foxitsoftware.com/pub/foxit/reader/desktop/win/6.x/6.2/enu/FoxitReader623.815_enu_Setup.exe) on your computer.

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/EliDeh/abschlussProjekt
# Go into the repository
cd abschlussProjekt
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app
npm start
```

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron in action.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](https://electronjs.org/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start).
